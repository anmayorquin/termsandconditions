<p class=MsoNormal>This Terms of Service (this “Agreement”) governs the
relationship between you and <span lang=EN-US>Golftrax</span> (hereinafter,
“Golftrax” “us,” or “we” and the possessive “our”) regarding your use of Golf<span
lang=EN-US>trax</span>® (collectively the “Service”) that you access through
our websites used (the “Website”) and/or our iOS or other type of application
licensed by Golftrax to facilitate your use of the Service (the
“Application”).  Reference to the Service or use of the Service herein means
through both the Website and the Application.  The Service is owned and
operated by <span lang=EN-US>Distribuidora Médica Veneta SA de CV.</span>The
terms “you,” “your,” and “yours” refer to anyone accessing, viewing, browsing,
visiting or using the Service in any manner by, through or under you or your
Account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use of the Service is also governed by Golftrax’s Privacy
Policy, the most current version of which can be found at https://<span
lang=EN-US>golftraxbet</span>.com/privacy-policy/ (the “Privacy Policy”), which
is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IMPORTANT – PLEASE READ CAREFULLY – THIS AGREEMENT CREATES A
LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT WHICH GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.  BY CREATING AN
ACCOUNT OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND, BY THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE
PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICE.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>License and Restrictions.</h1>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>License Grant for Service. </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Golftrax hereby grants you a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, revocable limited license solely for the period your Account
is active, to access and use the Service through the Website and/or
Application, and to install and run one copy of the Application on a single
mobile device.  You are responsible for obtaining all hardware necessary to run
the Application and for any fees, such as internet connection, data, or mobile
carrier fees that you incur when accessing the Service. We reserve all rights
not expressly granted herein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Accounts and Access.  </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>To use the Service, you must register for an account (an
“Account”).  Once your Account is registered, you may generally be referred to
as “User”.  Other users may be referred to generally as “Other Users” and you
and Other Users are sometimes collectively referred to as “Users.” Your Account
gives you access to the Service and functionality that we establish, maintain
and modify from time to time in our sole discretion. We may maintain different
types of accounts with different features or functionality for different types
of Users. If you open Account on behalf of a company, organization (such as a
team) or other entity, then (i) “you” includes you and that entity, and (ii)
you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the
entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement. By connecting
to Golftrax with a third-party service (such as Google, Facebook or other
social media sites), you give us permission to access and use your information
from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in
credentials for that service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Account Information and Management.</h1>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Information Provided When Setting Up Account. </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>You are required to provide and maintain current, complete
and accurate personal information, which may include (but is not limited to):
an e-mail address and password (“Login Information”), your name, birth date,
and, in some cases, payment information (collectively, with Login Information,
your “Account Information”).  You may not use a false identity or false
information or create an Account on behalf of someone other than yourself.  Do
not share your Account or Login Information, nor let anyone else access your
Account or otherwise jeopardize the security of your Account.  If you become
aware of, or suspect, any breach of security of your Account, including without
limitation any loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure of the Login Information,
you must immediately notify us and modify your Login Information. You are
solely responsible for all uses of the Account Information.  You are
responsible for any use of your credit card or other payment instrument (e.g.
PayPal) incurred by parties using your Account. You agree that we will not be
liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your Account. We
reserve the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any time and for any
reason (for example due to claims by a third party that a username violates the
third party’s rights). We cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will
not be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal information
for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal
information (including Account Information) at your own risk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
